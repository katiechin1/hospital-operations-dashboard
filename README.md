# Hospital Patient Flow & Efficiency Dashboard

An Excel-based business intelligence project analyzing hospital operational efficiency through patient wait times, arrival punctuality, and visit duration metrics.  
The dashboard identifies performance bottlenecks, highlights improvement opportunities, and provides data-driven recommendations for reducing patient delays.

---

## Problem Statement

Hospital leadership wants to understand how patient wait times vary across departments and what operational factors contribute to service delays.  
The goal is to reduce overall patient waiting time, improve scheduling efficiency, and enhance the patient experience — all without increasing staffing costs.

---

## Key Business Questions

1. Which departments experience the longest average patient wait times?  
2. How do peak hours and specific days of the week affect wait time performance?  
3. Is there a relationship between staffing ratios and patient wait durations?  
4. How do appointment type and insurance coverage impact wait times?  
5. What actions can be taken to improve patient flow and on-time service rates?

## Project Overview

This project uses Excel, Power Query, and PivotTables to analyze hospital workflow efficiency and patient throughput.  
It follows a structured business analysis framework focused on translating operational data into actionable insights.

**Key Documents**
- [Data Audit](./data_audit.md) — data quality checks, cleaning steps, and outlier handling  
- [KPI Definitions](./kpis.md) — metrics, formulas, and realistic performance targets  
- [Insights & Recommendations](./insights.md) — stakeholder-oriented findings and next steps  

---

## Tools and Skills Used
- **Microsoft Excel** (PivotTables, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)  
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation  
- **Data Analysis** (KPI definition, benchmarking, process metrics)  
- **Dashboard Design** (KPI cards, filters, and performance visuals)  
- **Business Insight Writing** (operational analysis and recommendations)

---

## Business Objectives

The dashboard helps hospital leaders:
- Identify departments with the highest average delays  
- Detect peak hours and days creating operational bottlenecks  
- Evaluate whether staffing or scheduling drives inefficiency  
- Prioritize measurable process and scheduling improvements  

---

## Key Outcomes

- Built a **5-KPI executive dashboard** for hospital operations leadership  
- Identified **Neurology** and **Surgery** as priority departments for process review  
- Revealed **peak congestion (8 AM–3 PM)** and busiest days (**Monday/Sunday**)  
- Demonstrated that **staffing levels are adequate** — delays stem from workflow inefficiencies  
- Delivered **actionable recommendations** for scheduling and triage optimization

## KPI Targets 

| KPI | Targets | Rationale |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **Average Wait (min)** | ≤ 90 min | Balanced benchmark for hospitals handling scheduled, walk-in, and emergency patients. |
| **% Waiting > 1 Hour** | ≤ 35% | Allows for variability across departments while encouraging improvement. |
| **% of Patients Arriving On Time** | ≥ 75% | Industry-standard punctuality goal. |
| **Time from Arrival → Check-in (min)** | ≤ 5 min | Reflects efficient front-desk performance. |
| **Total Time Spent in Hospital (min)** | ≤ 150 min | Represents full-cycle patient experience from arrival to discharge. |

For full KPI definitions and calculation logic, see [KPI Documentation](./kpis.md).

## Dashboard Layout Overview

The **Hospital Patient Flow & Efficiency Dashboard** guides administrators and analysts through key performance indicators, operational patterns, and improvement opportunities.

| Section | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **KPI Summary (Top Row)** | Displays five key metrics summarizing hospital performance: Average Wait, On-Time Rate, Long-Wait Share, Check-in Delay, and Total Time in Hospital. Each includes targets and color-coded indicators. |
| **Operational Visuals (Middle Section)** | Charts highlight department-level performance, daily and hourly trends, appointment and insurance breakdowns, and staffing correlations. |
| **Interactive Filters (Right Panel)** | Slicers allow users to explore data by Department, Day of Week, Appointment Type, and Insurance Type. |
| **Key Insights (Bottom Section)** | Summarizes findings and recommended next steps for performance improvement. |
